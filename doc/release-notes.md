How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Galactrum-Qt (on Mac) or
galactrumd/galactrum-qt (on Linux).
