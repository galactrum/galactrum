# This CMakeLists.txt is not meant to actually work!
# It only serves as a dummy project to make CLion work properly when it comes to symbol resolution and all the nice
# features dependent on that. Building must still be done on the command line using the automake build chain
# If you load this project in CLion and would like to run/debug executables, make sure to remove the "Build" entry from
# the run/debug configuration as otherwise CLion will try to build this project with cmake, failing horribly.
# You'll also have to manually change the executable in the configuration to the correct path of the already built executable
